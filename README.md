# TRAIN-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
 A ticket booking system on trains.

 The system code generation was done using the following programming languages and tools:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end development of the web-based user interface.
- PHP and MySQL for the back-end development of the web-based server and database.
- Visual Studio Code as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and editing the code.
- XAMPP as the web server solution stack for hosting the web application locally.
- Bootstrap as the front-end framework for designing responsive and mobile-friendly web pages.
The system code generation followed the system design specifications and requirements defined in the previous chapter. The system code generation consisted of the following main modules:
- User module: This module handles the user registration, login, profile management and password recovery functionalities. It also allows the user to search for available trains, book tickets, cancel tickets, view booking history and print tickets.
- Train module: This module handles the train information management, such as adding, updating, deleting and viewing train details, schedules, routes and fares. It also allows the train operator to check the seat availability, occupancy and revenue of each train.
- Admin module: This module handles the admin functions, such as managing users, trains, bookings, cancellations, reports and feedback. It also allows the admin to monitor the system performance, security and reliability.
The system code generation followed the coding standards and best practices, such as proper indentation, comments, naming conventions, modularity, reusability and error handling. The system code generation also followed the software engineering principles, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and cohesion.

HOW TO OPEN THE SYSTEM
